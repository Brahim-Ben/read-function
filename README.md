# read-function
        this project is about how i can print line by line from file using 
function read and static variable and other functions.
        i'm reading BUFFER_SIZE of characters using read and stock in buffer using function read 
and every time i checking if i find a new line ever time i find it the function 
return this until '\n' so evrey time i call the function get_next_line it's gonna 
return a line in file what from give to her.
